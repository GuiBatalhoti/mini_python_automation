# Mini automation

This is a mini automation to create the pdf file I send to my teacher os practice lists.
As I do the by hand, I need to take the pictures and add to a file to send.
This is really tedious taks, so I decided to automate  it.

Type in:
1. the name you want in the file (with no extension);
2. the directory to save the files;
3. the directory of the images.

The images name should be numbered from 1 to N pictures and be ".jpeg", only them should be in the directory.
It will be created a ".docx" file with the specified name and directory. And a ".pdf" file in th same directory with the same name.
